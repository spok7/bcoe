# Buoyancy-Controlled Ocean Exploration (BCOE)

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of ocean navigation using buoyancy-controlled
glider-like probes by adapting classical path planning approaches to limited-actuation flow fields and
demonstrating the feasibility of exploring the ocean in this way. If this goal is reached, we intend to
expand the scope of our project to find the shortest trajectories that explore the most ocean area.
Additionally, we want to demonstrate the possibility of traveling to a specified goal location or region,
e.g. to send data, for recovery, or to investigate a site of interest.
